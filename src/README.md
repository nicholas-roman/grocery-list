For the "List" section, the loader I found online is from https://loading.io/css/

For the "Status" section, where I used the rainbow text, I used the code from https://welearncode.com/rainbow-text/

For the "Show Expenses" section, the dot loader styling I used was based off code from https://css-tricks.com/loading-dots-plugin/
